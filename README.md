This machine learning model is built for predicting the price of homes in bengaluru . We did data preprocessing – Handled NA values, Feature Engineering –  created new columns ‘bhk’ and sq. feet per price, converted sq. feet few string value into float, dimensionality reduction – reduced number of location, outlier removal using std deviation and mean,used one hot encoding for location, built mode using linear regression, used k fold cross validation to measure the accuracy of linear regression model,gridsearchcv.
Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
