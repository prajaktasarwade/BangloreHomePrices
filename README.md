**- Project Objective** 
- To predict the price of homes in bengalore location using machine learning linear regression.

**-Task**


1.This machine learning model is built for predicting the price of homes in bengaluru . We did data preprocessing – Handled NA values.

2.Feature Engineering –  created new columns ‘bhk’ and sq. feet per price, converted sq. feet few string value into float. 

3.Dimensionality reduction – reduced number of location.

4.Outlier removal using std deviation and mean,used one hot encoding for location, built mode using linear regression.

5.Used k fold cross validation to measure the accuracy of linear regression model,gridsearchcv.

**-Library Used**
Python ,Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning,Matplotlib for data visualization,Sklearn for model building.
